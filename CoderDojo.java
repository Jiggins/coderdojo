/*
 * This class is the main class for our mod.  The two @EventHandler methods below is similar to a main method.
 * This is where all the methods and objects from all other classes will be called.
 * This code will produce a lot of errors as its being typed because we use so many different classes.  
 * Usually the fix is simply pressing ctrl+shift+o to automatically import the required classes.
 * 
 * Note: Don't worry about the imports in any of these classes
 * eclipse will automatically import everything needed with the shortcut
 * ctrl+shift+o (Mac: Command+shift+o)
 * if it asks you what to import, always pick the one with either forge, fml or minecraft in its name.
